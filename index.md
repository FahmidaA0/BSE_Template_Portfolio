# LED Cyclone Game
I am working on the LED Cyclone Game. I am utilizing an addressable neopixel strip, an arduino uno board, and a push button. This project reminisces on games that would appear in the arcade.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to light up the neopixel. The interface of the neopixel composes of the positive wire voltage, negative wire ground, and data wire. A diode is controlled by an integrated circuit that gains information and changes to data to manage the light. This data is then passed on to the next diode; it is an ongoing process. To power my neopixel I used alligator clips to connect the ground circuit of the LED strip to the ground pin on the arduino. I also used alligator clips to connect the voltage circuit of the LED circuit to the pin 5V on the arduino. Then I used a jumper wire to connect the data wire to digital pin 5 on the arduino uno board. Lastly, I opened up the Arduino IDE to upload the operation "ColorPalette".
